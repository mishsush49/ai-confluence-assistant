Objective: Generate a Python script that publishes content along with an image to a Confluence page. The script should read important configuration details such as Confluence URL, username, API token, and space key from a .env file. The image path should be passed as a command-line argument.

Requirements:
A. Configuration Details:
1. Read Confluence URL, username, API token, and space key from a .env file.
2. Use the python-dotenv package to load environment variables from the .env file.

B. Image Upload:
1. The image path should be passed as a command-line argument.
2. Use the requests library to upload the image to the Confluence page.
3. Ensure the image is uploaded as binary data without any decoding issues.

C. Page Creation/Update:
1. Check if the page already exists. If it does, update the existing page; otherwise, create a new page.
2. Update the page content to include the uploaded image using the <ac:image> macro.

D. Error Handling:
1. Handle any potential errors, such as incorrect image paths or API issues.
